BADGE.TEAM is a collaboration effort of multiple engineers, designers and enthousiasts who use their skills to create awesome badges for non-profit hacker events.

We started as a small team of volunteers for SHA2017, but by now we're an international group of cooperating teams that work together to deliver awesome event badges all around the world.

Each of these teams shares a set of common goals: we design our badges to be useful after the event they were made for, and we aim to have the badges ready for handout before the start of the event, so that people can enjoy their gadget on location for as long as possible.
